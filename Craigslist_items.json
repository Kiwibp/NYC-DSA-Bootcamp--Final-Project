It has the manual trim setting so you can run nose high for speed or nose down for skiing or tubing.  This is the 3 person ski and it is made for comfort.  Gauge cluster works and is crystal clear, no fogging.  Seat is in perfect condition.  It comes with a remote to lock the ski so no one can steal it and it also activates the training mode for learning purposes.  The body has a couple small places on it as I have tried to show in the pictures, most ski's get this much damage really quick.  No dock rash at all.  The keel has the normal scratches on it but no gouges or holes.  New battery less than a year ago.   Fresh spark plugs with oil and filter change and I have the old oil and filter if you are interested in checking it out.   Compression is great.  All cylinders are between 180 and 190 psi, see pictures, and I can do it again if cash in hand.  Trailer is in great condition.  It has been adult owned its whole time.  It has been kept in a heated garage all winter so no worries of freezing.   It comes with the trailer, cover, one remote, and the fresh water flush hose adapter.  I am not interested in any trades so don't ask.  I am not needing to sell so no lowball offers.   Price is firm.   CASH only.  Calls ONLY due to all the texting and email spam.

","\n","\nThe jaguar XF is impressive, stylish and full of power.","\n","\nThis XF is Equipped with a V6 3.0 Supercharged engine with an 8 speed Automatic transmission. The 3.0 Supercharged gives you 340hp and remarkable performance. ","\n","\nThe XF is by far the smoothest ride I have ever driven. The electronic suspension provides you with a very pleasant ride whether your cruising or wanting to whip through the curves this thing will grip the ground and GO. If you are looking for speed, hit the checkered flag button and it will take the performance to a whole another level. ","\n","\nThe appearance is stunning and definitely turns heads out on the road!","\n","\nIt is a Jaguar so you know it comes fully loaded, I will name some of my favorite features. It has all powered, top grain heated leather seats, touch screen navigation that has many options including Bluetooth for your music and hands-free driving, rear backup camera and parking sensors on the front and backside, also has auto adjusting mirrors which all make backing up easier. Blind spot sensors on mirrors. Auto bright headlights which means it senses oncoming cars and will turn your high beams off and back on accordingly. Auto start/stop which means the car has the ability to shut off at a stop light and automatically start back up when you hit the gas. Sunroof. Keyless entry and keyless start. Powered blind shade in rear window. Much more. ","\n","\nThis car sold new for around 60 grand. ","\n","\nWe are obviously offering you this vehicle at a significantly lower price. We specialize in Jaguar rebuilds and particularly the XF. I personally own a couple of these myself that we did rebuilds on, so I am a big fan. We purchased this vehicle from an insurance company after it was involved in a light wreck. We were SHOCKED that this car was issued a salvage title. ","\n","\nHowever, the vehicle has been completely repaired and has been issued a rebuilt title. We do have before pictures of the car if you would like to see them before purchasing. The front bumper, hood and fender only needed repaired and not replaced so that tells you it wasn't that much of a hit. The front wheel was replaced along with the upper control arm and few other small pieces. There were NO air-bags deployed, this was a light hit and a very easy fix. ","\n","\nThe state of Tennessee inspected the vehicle to assure the rebuilt has been done according to manufacturer specifications before issuing the rebuilt title. Having a rebuilt title does not mean anything in my opinion, the title looks exactly the same as a clear title, you can receive the same insurance on the vehicle as a clear title. The only difference is you are saving $$$$.","\n","\nThe vehicle is located in Kodak, TN. 30 Minutes east of Knoxville. Just off the same exit as Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg.

","\nEspecially good for:","\n•Mothers recovering from c-section","\n•Families with an older child at home (prevents older siblings from trying to 'feed' new baby things like Legos or acorns, etc)","\n•Traveling for visits to family/friends where house has animals or is not childproofed ","\n•Bringing baby to bathroom so mom can take shower","\n•And more!","\n","\nThis Highchair/Skychair(our term for the infant seat!) is incredibly versatile and continued to surprise us with all the features! It's height adjustable, the infant bucket seat detaches to serve as a table-top or floor unit, the highchair seat reclines for easy bottle feeding once baby has outgrown the bucket seat, and the 'Skychair' combo (infant setup) packs easily into car for travel. Oh, and the front wheels are lockable, to dissuade siblings from introducing early joyrides to little sister/brother. The infant bucket seat has a play bar that can be folded out above baby to play with plush stars, but (!) we are missing one of the stars and in my opinion, the play bar was always a little flimsy. I continue to search for the missing star, though, and promise to contact buyer in future should it turn up.

It has 267k miles. My mom bought the car some time back in the early 2000's, and was the 2nd owner. It has always been a midlands South Carolina car. My little brother drove it in college and following. It's been a great car. Still has all the power you'd expect from a Maxima, even even you're passing someone on the interstate.  Tires are great on the alloys! Sunroof and windows work. Cloth seats. It is dirty. It has dents and dings. People have brushed up against it from time to time. A deer ran into the side of it years back. It has clearcoat flakes. The armrest is broken. The alternator needs a replacement bolt, but it is held tight in place, and doesn't move. (People tend to lose the top bolt for some reason in these.) If I kept it forever, I'd probably do a tune up and change the engine seals. It does leak oil like an old Nissan. (We'll call it built-in corrosion protection for the engine bay, hahaha!) However, it'll crank every time, drive quickly anywhere you need to go, and do so reliably. It doesn't seem to be leaking any fluids other than oil. This is just an extra car for us, and I have loaned it out to friends who drive it thousands of miles without a problem. If you need a good starter car that you don't have to worry about denting, this is the one. The engines/transmissions usually go 400k miles or so, so it should be good for you for a while if you continue to take good care of it mechanically like my family did!

We sell mostly online and ship all over the country, but we would like to do more business locally. All of the furniture we make is custom made to order, and made from American hardwoods: ash, red oak, white oak, maple, ambrosia maple, curly maple, quarter-sawn white oak, cherry and walnut. Our furniture is finely sanded and finished simply in non-toxic linseed oil, to reveal the natural color and beauty of the wood grain. We build a lot of furniture for chemically sensitive people, often beds for people buying organic mattresses. With everything we build, we think about safety, usability, functionality and durability of our pieces for generations of use. We do not offer any wood stain, but some people buy our furniture unfinished to stain or paint themselves.","\n","\nWe do not have a storefront, but would love to hear from you if you are interested in getting a piece made. You are welcome to come to our shop by appointment, to select lumber, see our work in progress, or discuss specifications. We offer so many custom options, including different leg choices, mixed woods, beds set up for a mattress only or mattress + box springs, larger or smaller headboards and rails, etc. You can see more pictures and prices at our website www.mountainmulehardwoods.com and Etsy, or follow us on Facebook and Instagram. (Most Etsy prices include shipping, so please inquire if you want local pricing.) We deliver to Tri-Cities, Asheville, Knoxville, and even farther for larger orders. We do offer a discount when buying several pieces. Before you buy poorly-constructed Chinese-made furniture from a chain furniture store, consider getting something built to last from solid American hardwoods and supporting a hard-working family-owned local small business. :)","\n","\nPlatform beds without a headboard (no shipping, includes kiln-dried poplar slats) start around:","\nTwin $650  |  Full $675  |  Queen $700  |  King/Cal King $725","\n","\nPlatform beds with a small 12\" headboard (no shipping, includes kiln-dried poplar slats) start around:","\nTwin $800  |  Full $825  |  Queen $850  |  King/Cal King $875","\n","\nWalnut (the darkest wood) is the most expensive wood choice, and for example, a king with a 20\" headboard and kiln-dried poplar slats would be around $1500 without shipping.","\n","\nCall, text or email us, and we will get back to you as soon as we can.

","\n","\nCURLY AMBROSIA MAPLE","\nThis beautiful and unusual wood can really make a statement in your bedroom! Ambrosia Maple is maple that has been infested by ambrosia beetles, which cause grayish blue to brown streaks over the golden or pinkish colored maple. Not to worry- once kiln dried, the bugs are gone! The head and footboard of this bed are also curly, which is not a common occurrence. Ambrosia maple is sometimes called wormy maple or ghost maple, because the shapes can look like ghosts. Because wood is a natural product, its beauty marks are normal, and may include knots, knot holes, worm holes, large streaks or sections of light or blond sapwood and/or variations in grain and color. These variations are what make this a one-of-a-kind piece. ","\n","\nOUR BEDS ","\nOur bed frames are handcrafted from furniture-grade kiln-dried solid American hardwoods.

We sell mostly online and ship all over the country, but we would like to do more business locally. All of the furniture we make is custom made to order, and made from American hardwoods: ash, red oak, white oak, maple, ambrosia maple, curly maple, quarter-sawn white oak, cherry and walnut. Our furniture is finely sanded and finished simply in non-toxic linseed oil, to reveal the natural color and beauty of the wood grain. We build a lot of furniture for chemically sensitive people, often beds for people buying organic mattresses. With everything we build, we think about safety, usability, functionality and durability of our pieces for generations of use. We do not offer any wood stain, but some people buy our furniture unfinished to stain or paint themselves.","\n","\nWe do not have a storefront, but would love to hear from you if you are interested in getting a piece made. You are welcome to come to our shop by appointment, to select lumber, see our work in progress, or discuss specifications. We offer so many custom options, including different leg choices, mixed woods, a more durable finish, etc. You can see more pictures and prices at our website www.mountainmulehardwoods.com and Etsy, or follow us on Facebook and Instagram. (Most Etsy prices include shipping, so please inquire if you want local pricing.) We deliver to Tri-Cities, Asheville, Knoxville, and even farther for larger orders. We do offer a discount when buying several pieces. Before you buy poorly-constructed Chinese-made furniture from a chain furniture store, consider getting something built to last from solid American hardwoods and supporting a hard-working family-owned local small business. :)","\n","\nPrices are approximate and depend on size and if there's a drawer and/or a shelf.","\n","\nNightstands and End Tables: $400 - $650","\nCoffee Tables and Benches: $550 - $900","\nEntry and Accent Tables: $450 - $650","\nConsole Tables: $600 - $900","\nDining Tables: $850 +","\nButcher Block Islands: $800 +","\n","\nCall, text or email us, and we will get back to you as soon as we can.

I love the truck as does everyone else who sees it. It looks great, runs great, and sounds great! I'm sure I'll forget something but here's my best attempt. On the outside: it has newer style towing mirrors with smoked lens', roof rack, LED light bar, black diamond plate low profile toolbox, Harley Davidson head lights with HID bulbs, nice jet black paint job with painted to match pocket fender flares, Moto Metal 20\" Diesel wheels with great tread Mickey Thompson Baja ATZ tires, great sounding 5\" exhaust, with K\u0026N air filter. It has the EGR delete and blue spring fuel mod. I just installed 2 brand new batteries in November. It has an SCT tuner, tuned for fuel economy. On the inside: Tan cloth interior (normal driver side seat tear), all new speakers in factory locations with an amp mounted under the front center seat, Pioneer in-dash touch screen DVD player that does everything including hands-free, Bluetooth, and has a backup camera. Behind the rear seat is a new single 10\" sub with its own dedicated amp mounted under the rear seats, roof mounted flip down DVD player, and tinted windows. The \"issues\": there is a vacuum leak somewhere that makes the heat/air default to only blowing through the defroster and also causing you to have to manually lock the hubs for 4X4 and the vinyl cover for the center console is missing but is only aesthetics, I've just never bothered to recover it. Truck is super nice and a BEAST! I cant go anywhere without people wanting to talk about it and is super dependable, I would not hesitate to drive this truck anywhere at any time! Please text first if your interested. Only looking for the best offer over $14,999! The truck lives in Fletcher NC. Text  ","\n. Thanks    "],"Latitude":"35.449900","Longitude":"-82.496600"}

","\nThe 2017 Sea Land'r trailer is included in this package as well.","\n","\nThis Sea Doo Spark is playful, easy-to-ride and easy to tow with a small car. Maptuner was used to tune sea doo from it's original 60 HP to 90 HP (ROTAX 900 HO ACE - 899 cc four-stroke engine specs.) This is an expensive, performance upgrade! It allows for the creation of the most compact and lightweight engine on the market. Built with the acclaimed Advanced Combustion Efficiency technology it's also the most fuel-efficient watercraft in the industry¹ while still delivering excellent power-to-weight ratio.)","\n","\nThis machine screams out of the hole! Fast and fun on the water. As pictured, there are only 34 hours and 34 minutes on it. There is only normal, minor wear and tear from minimal use on the water.

It was designed for hull and deck applications to maintain the structural integrity of the watercraft under stress while providing light yet durable parts to support the construction of the product.","\niTC™ (INTELLIGENT THROTTLE CONTROL) SYSTEM","\nFly-by-wire system that works electronically (no cables) to transfer the input from the throttle lever to the engine. It's a more responsive and precise throttle control that generates better engine calibration and fuel consumption. It also allows for different riding modes like the sport mode that's available with the Rotax 900 HO ACE engine and it's activated by pressing the button under the cluster for 3 seconds.","\nD-SEA-BEL™ SYSTEM","\nCombines a series of resonators and vibration-absorbing components to make Sea-Doo watercraft some of the quietest on the water.","\nClosed-Loop Cooling System","\nUses coolant to keep the engine running at the ideal temperature, much like a car's radiator. Also keeps out corrosive saltwater and debris.","\nInteractive Multifunction Digital Information Center","\nTouring mode, Sport mode (HO engine), Fuel level, Tachometer, Speedometer, Hour meter.","\nStainless steel impeller","\nDelivers improved acceleration, higher top speed and less cavitation.","\nOther","\nHandlegrips with palm rest","\nSponsons","\nWetgrip footboard","\nKnee pad","\nTow hook","\nRear grab handle","\nSeat strap","\nSingle drain plug","\nFlush Kit","\nEmergency floating lanyard","\nOperator's guide, instructional video and booklet","\n","\n","\n    "],"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null}

They can be seen in the 2nd photo with close up pictures at the end.* Hello :) This is a very large lot of  Star Wars toys, figures, etc. My 12 year old used to collect these. She really didn't play with them much and they have been in tubs in her closet for a couple of years. She decided she wants to pass them along to somebody else. You get everything shown in the pictures. The Darth Vader helmet does work. It talks when you push the buttons and has a microphone inside you can talk into. The 2 lightsabers work as well. I checked it all. You just have to add batteries. The cup has 2 toppers that fit on top with the straw. The fabric is vintage from \"Return of the Jedi\" made in 1983. It unfolds to double what you see in the pictures. The figures basically range from 1995-newer. And there's all sorts of them. There are a few figures that are missing a piece or so. There are alot of guns and extra pieces as well. Everything you will receive can be seen in the pictures. Overall this is a great Star Wars collection. Please just message me with the craigslist reply and I will promptly message you back and we can work out all the details. I can meet you. Thanks alot!!! :)    "],"Latitude":"35.586910","Longitude":"-82.597149"}

There's no sound coming from the tweeters, but there is from the woofer. The cabinets are in good shape, especially considering their age. They're made in real walnut veneer, with solid walnut and brass accents and look like a fine piece of furniture. Check out the gold inlays! There are some bumps and bruises, but I've taken good quality pics so there are no surprises. They were produced between 1973-1976, and are 25 x 15 x 11, and weigh approximately 40lbs. Sold as is.

Using the same great EPI 8\" module, this cabinet attains a system resonance of 35 cycles. This allows linear woofer operation down to the primary octave of all musical material even when positioned in a free standing location away from the walls in the center of a room, or similarly in the center of a large bookshelf. Depending on the size of the room a two wall positioning may be preferable.","\n","\nNew construction and design principles are utilized in the Model 150 to provide an optimum combination of high performance and decorative cabinetry appearance. Functional in this design are the four anodized metal extrusions in each side which are first joined to solid walnut corner pieces are then attached mechanically to top and bottom caps (both one inch thick) where the walnut plugs are accented by circular brass inserts.","\n","\nAs a finished piece of furniture, the Model 150 is a handsome creation of gleaming brass, rich solid walnut and a dark warm grill cloth. In a vertical position its 25\" height makes an attractive end table. An 11\" depth and beautiful symmetry permit its use as a magnificent bookshelf system as well.

I can build chicken coops, sheds, decks, retaining walls, ramps, hang siding, paint interior or exteriors, etc.. If you have a wood/material preference we can discuss this before committing to a design.

Preparing to move overseas - must sell. ","\n","\nMore info:","\n","\nFender Musical Instruments Corporation is proud to introduce the most revolutionary and ambitious new product in its fifty-five year history: The Cyber-Twin amplifier. The first amplifier ever capable of Cybernetic Amp Design (C.A.D.) technology that actually re-creates circuitry, the Cyber-Twin utilizes both analog and digital components to instantly become over 120 of the world's most sought after classic and modern classic amplifiers tones. Fender's world class team of engineers have spent more than three years of research and development on this extraordinary new amplifier. From day one, the intention was to follow the long-standing Fender tradition of innovation, and to set the standard by which all amplifiers will follow in the future. The result is the future of amplifiers, the Cyber-Twin","\n","\nNot another modeling� amp, the Cyber-Twin is a warehouse filled with the best of history's amplifiers housed in one cabinet, and whose electronic architecture literally reconfigures itself to become the amplifier that is selected. While a specific tonal quality may be digitally replicated by a modeling� amp to give a snapshot of an amplifier at a single setting, C.A.D. makes it possible for the Cyber-Twin to recreate the original amplifier's schematic and maintain its sonic personality, allowing it to become that amplifier.","\n","\nSenior vice president of marketing for Fender, Ritchie Fliegler, explains, DSP modeling amps may provide a one-dimensional snapshot of a very specific moment in time where a certain guitar is played at a certain volume by adjusting its equalizer. Once you turn up the gain or lower the treble, that moment is gone forever, and so is the amplifier the DSP is trying to emulate.","\n","\nC.A.D. literally reconfigures the Cyber-Twin's tone stack, as if there were a tiny robot inside with a soldering iron building each one of the amps,� adds Fliegler. Once the specific circuitry has been dialed up, the Cyber-Twin is an actual amplifier that delivers the living, breathing response of the original. If you dial up a classic Fender amplifier like a Bassman or a 65 Twin, you couldn't tell the difference if you were blindfolded.�","\n","\nThe versatility of the Cyber-Twin, however, does not stop at classic and modern classic Fender tones. While most Fender amplifiers feature a tone stack that's placed before the preamp, many other classic sounds are from amplifiers that have the tone stack after the preamp, like many of the popular British models. The Cyber-Twin has the capability of moving the tone stack either before or after the preamp, offering the best of American and British amplifier voicings.","\n","\nWith the familiar Fender control panel, the Cyber-Twin is playable right out of the box. There are 35 classic and modern classic pre-set amplifiers to choose from, which are accessible by a large control dial. Playing a Bassman, for example, is as simple as dialing it up and using the standard amplifier controls to get a desired tone. Using the world's most revered amplifier circuits its building blocks, the Cyber-Twin also allows players to design their own amplifier sounds. The Custom Shop function features 85 of Fender's own pre-set creations, all of which are fully adjustable to allow musicians to go as deep as they want into their own personal tonal preferences. Once adjusted, new sounds can be saved in the Player's Lounge for 85 added possibilities.","\n","\nFour Quick Access keys provide instant assignment and recall of a player's favorite Amp Design pre-sets, all of which can also be accessed remotely with the included four-button footswitch.","\n","\nThe Cyber-Twin features 130 Watts of stereo output (65 Watts per channel) through 2x12� Celestion G12T-100 speakers (8 Ohms). Two 12AX7WA vacuum tubes are used in the preamp, and there are four tone stacks which can be placed before or after the distortion circuitry. The Cyber-Twin truly is the Holy Grail of all amplifiers, explains Fliegler. With Cybernetic Amp Design, we've taken musical possibilities to a level never before attainable with one single amp. What we've created is the future of amplifiers.    "],"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null}

It is 34 feet long and we have had it almost a year.  We've only been able to camp in it once, due to the upgrades we did lasting through camping season.  We absolutely love this RV and truly hate to think of selling it, but it would help us financially is the only reason we are willing to part with it.  When we purchased it last year it had a few minor leaks, which we sealed and repaired the damage inside none of the leaks we repaired we from the roof and the floor wasn't effected either.  We updated the interior during this process as well.  It has brand new laminate flooring, and new carpet around the doghouse.  New led reading lights in the bedroom.  We painted the cabinets with the high end enamel cabinet paint.  The shower and sink in the bathroom has been painted to update it with marine grade paint.  We also turned a wardrobe into a set of bunkbeds, so this RV would easily sleep 7.  The sofa is a jack knife sofa, and the dinette also converts to a bed.  The awning is functional, but has seen better days.  All the window awnings are in good shape minus some sun fading, except one which still provides shade but needs to be replaced.  It has a brand new CO2 detector, brand new queen size mattress thats only been slept on once!  It has an Onan generator.  The parking break needs to be repaired, we've always used scotches so it hasn't bothered us, but wanted to mention it.  As far as we know mechanically everything works well, and there aren't any leaks.  We aren't sure about the propane system and the furnace, because we haven't really tested them.  There is some staining above the shower that was there when we bought it, but it's not soft and hasn't leaked since we've owned it.  There are a few cosmetic flaws on the exterior, but nothing too bad.  We really do hate to even think about selling it, and are actually not going to be upset if we don't.  We've invested a lot of time, effort, and money into the upgrades and would be perfectly happy camping it for a long time to come.  It only has 38,545 miles on it and runs very strong.

The motif is silver, black, white and red. There are pinstripes along the sides with delicate red flames that were applied to shiny, solid metal siding. No leaks! The rims are custom red ones with newer Goodyear tires of thick tread. The box is 17 feet, tongue hitch adds 2-3 more ft. I do not know the towing weight.","\n","\nThe floor was redone with black and white vinyl tile to match the black cushion upholstery. The cabinets were all refaced with a textured black metal that gives it a mod look. There is a newer refrigerator/freezer unit, in addition to a vintage electric/propane combo fridge above it. There is a 4 burner stove top with an oven. Wall outlets work and there is lighting. The ice-cold air conditioner is a quality Dometic combo air/heat ceiling unit that matches the black cabinets. There is adequate working space with facilities for a food service operation. ","\n","\nThe kitchen table converts to a full-sized bed. The bench seat area also allows for a full-sized mattress. Storage is abundant and throughout camper seats and overhead. A small drop-down table top is opposite the back wall, which was converted into a hatch that opens wide and can be secured open by chains to attach to embedded hooks. (See silver hatch in photo to view size). I understand it was open to an outdoor grill and allowed the passing of food items back and forth for rapid production. Plenty of windows light it up with sunshine. An exterior aluminum window cover folds down over the front windows. This camper makes a suitable dwelling for 1-2 people, especially a couple. No bathroom, but spacious open area in back allows room for commode and portable shower set-up for the savvy soul. Kitchen sink drains out through outflow pipe under exterior of camper.","\n","\nThere is an awning and pull-out metal stairs. One portion of a panel of jalousie window cracked and has been sealed in with gorilla tape, no leaks. Included is a pre-cut pane of glass to fit the panel. There is also one other crack across one other window panel, though sealed and leak-proof. The tiles have seen traffic, though they are still intact, small areas of wear are evident. One small area of wood paneling has become frayed on the surface, yet the thickness of the wall is fully intact. There is a key for the door to lock up.","\n","\nWe love this camper, but are upgrading in other areas of life, so we will sell her to a good home. Because SC does not require a title for trailers, it does not have one. A NC title can be applied for using the \"home made\" trailer designation, similarly to a new tiny home title, if you plan to roll her far and wide.

The motif is silver, black, white and red. There are pinstripes along the sides with delicate red flames that were applied to shiny, solid metal siding. No leaks! The rims are custom red with newer Goodyear tires of thick tread. The box is 17 feet, tongue hitch adds 2-3 more ft. I do not know the towing weight. ","\n","\nThe floor was redone with black and white vinyl tile to match the black cushion upholstery. The cabinets were all refaced with a textured black metal that gives it a mod look. There is a newer refrigerator/freezer unit, in addition to a vintage electric/propane combo fridge above it. There is a 4 burner stove top with an oven. Wall outlets work and there is lighting. The ice-cold air conditioner is a quality Dometic combo air/heat ceiling unit that matches the black cabinets. There is a direct line for water hook-up to the double kitchen sink. There is adequate working space with facilities for a food service operation.","\n","\nThe kitchen table converts to a full-sized bed. The bench seat area also allows for a full-sized mattress. Storage is abundant and throughout camper seats and overhead. A small drop-down table top is opposite the back wall, which was converted into a hatch that opens wide and can be secured open by chains to attach to embedded hooks. (See silver hatch in photo to view size). Plenty of windows light it up with sunshine. An exterior aluminum window cover folds down over the front windows. This camper makes a suitable dwelling for 1-2 people, especially a couple. No bathroom, but spacious open area in back allows room for commode and portable shower set-up for the savvy soul. Kitchen sink drains out through outflow pipe underneath camper.","\n","\nThere is an awning and pull-out metal stairs. One portion of a panel of jalousie window cracked and has been sealed in with gorilla tape, no leaks. Included is a pre-cut pane of glass to fit the panel. There is also one other crack across one other window panel, though sealed and leak-proof. The tiles have seen traffic, though they are still intact, small areas of wear are evident. One area of wood paneling has become frayed on the surface, yet the thickness of the wall is fully intact. There is a key for the door to lock up.","\n","\nWe love this camper, but are upgrading in other areas of life, so we will sell her to a good home.

Drove it for six months until he bought himself a truck. Then it sat in our driveway for the past year. When he bought it, the odometer had already stopped working, so we do not know exactly how many miles is on it. The odometer now reads 230,000. In order to get it up and running and sell it, we took it to the mechanic a couple of months ago. Put over $600 worth of work into it. The mechanic said that he found a small transmission fluid leak. I drove it for a month straight after getting it out of the mechanics, and regularly checked the transmission fluid and it did not seem to have a significant impact on the transmission fluid level. But we did add a little bit after a month of driving it. It also tends to use a lot of oil, so it is good to check the oil level and add oil occasionally. I noticed today as I was cleaning out the trunk that it seems you have a leak in the trunk and there is dampness and moisture back there. It also appears that new tires are going to be needed at some point. I will say, that for the month of January while I was driving it, it ran pretty smoothly and I did not have any big issues with it. I was only driving it because my car was in the shop. I want to get it sold because we no longer need it. Asking $1800 OBO. You can text me 828-two79-five885    "],"Latitude":"35.712600","Longitude":"-82.549100"}

I've only had it for one year, but we just do not have the time and energy to invest in getting her exactly where she needs to be. So it is a project that needs to be passed along to someone that can put their love and devotion into it. It is basically functional as is, but there are some upgrades and remodels that it definitely needs. My husband did put new tires on it last summer and we took it down to the beach. We did not use the water system only the electricity. The guy I bought it from last year said that a family of three was living in it while their house was getting built, so as far as I know the water system is also functional. We bought a brand new window AC unit for it. My husband also bought several sheets of wood paneling to start replacing some of the deteriorated and rotted wall sections. He did complete one section behind the main bed. So the camper will come with the sheets of paneling and the brand new air conditioner. My husband also bought a new hitch for it. I had it deep cleaned Last Summer. Although it's been sitting for awhile and could use another good cleaning. So we have invested close to $700 in it already. But as I say, it still needs some upgrades and remodels to really get it up to where she deserves to be. The pictures I took are of the beds pulled out for sleeping. But the main bed pushes back into a couch. The middle bed folds up and a table goes there. It also has a little loft bed above the main bed. My husband was able to identify one leak around the window area that he sealed and fixed.  He also sealed the entire roof last summer.

Doug","\n","\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","\n","\nFor you tech-heads...here is Mackie's Technical Specifications on this Mixing Board.","\n","\nSource URL: http://www.fullcompass.com/common/files/2033-CFXSeriesDataSheet.pdf","\n ","\nThe CFX™ Series mixers are comprised of stereo graphic equalizer and digital effects built in. The EMAC™ 32-bit digital effects processor was custom designed by our digital engineers and rivals the sound of many high-quality outboard processors. Like all of Mackie Designs' mixers, the CFX Series mixers are designed for rugged, day-in and day-out road use. Their sturdy-yet-light steel monocoque construction houses rugged, double-sided SMT-plated fiberglass circuit boards, and 60 mm faders with ultra-tight lip seals for keeping out dust and other contaminants. Impact resistant knobs are mounted so they \"ride\" just above the steel chassis--they absorb impact without trouble. Furthermore, they're designed to last, thanks to co-molded potentiometers that do not get brittle and crack up. Metal stand-offs are used at regular intervals to mount thick fiberglass circuit boards inside the mixer. These are extremely flexible mixers, not only because of their multiple input/output configurations, but also because of their 4 subgroups, 9-band graphic EQ, and built-in digital effects.","\n","\nThe CFX•20 has 16 mic/line channels and two stereo line input channels. All mic/line channels have unbalanced inserts. Each channel strip has one external and one internal/external effects send plus two aux sends, pan, mute, solo (PFL), bus assigns, and 60 mm log-taper fader. The mic/line channels also have input trim controls with individual Zero Level LEDs, 3-band EQ with swept midrange, and 100 Hz low cut filters. Two separate stage monitor mixes can be created with their own effects levels. ","\nThe CFX Series is a true 4-bus mixer, with four sub bus faders and master ganged Left/Right fader. Outputs include XLR and TRS balanced/unbalanced main outputs, a 75 Hz low-pass subwoofer XLR output, extra TRS","\nFeatures","\n•\u0009High headroom mic preamps","\n•\u0009CFX•16 channels (12 mic/line mono, 2 stereo line","\n•\u000932-bit EMAC digital effects","\n•\u0009External and internal EFX sends","\n•\u0009EFX to Monitor control","\n•\u00099-band stereo graphic equalizer","\n•\u0009Inserts on all mic channels and main mix","\n•\u0009True 4-bus design with direct sub outs and L/R assign","\n•\u00092 Pre/Post aux sends and internal/external FX level sends","\n•\u00093-band EQ with swept mid (100 Hz to 8 kHz) on mic/line","\n•\u00094-band EQ on stereo line channels","\n•\u0009Pan, Mute, PFL solo on each channel","\n•\u0009100 Hz low-cut filters on all mic/line channels","\n•\u0009Subwoofer output from built-in 18 dB/octave, 75 Hz crossover","\n•\u0009Break switch mutes all channels","\n•\u0009Headphone output with level control","\n•\u0009Tape/CD inputs with level control assignable to Main Mix via Break switch","\n•\u0009Logarithmic taper 60 mm faders","\n•\u000948 V phantom power","\n•\u000912 V BNC lamp jack applications","\n•\u0009Live sound mixing for Churches, Clubs, Schools, Conference Centers, Tradeshows, Presentations, Keyboard, Drum Machine, and DJ mixing","\n•\u0009A/V presentations, multimedia","\n","\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","\n","\nSCAMMERS...SAVE YOUR BREATH.

This Snare Drum was designed by Jim Riley and manufactured and sold by Ludwig, who endorses Jim Riley, the Drummer and Band Leader of Rascal Flatts. This is a very rare drum and the only one available on craigslist, Ebay or like it in the world. In fact, it's the only autographed one I've ever seen listed anywhere. It's certainly one any collector must have for their private collection. It is in like new condition with three small wear spots on the rims...see attached pics of highlighted area. The owner of the Drum Center in Reno, Nevada that I purchased it from stated these spots may have been caused by a microphone mount during the Drum Clinic he sponsored for Jim Riley in 2013. If you wasn't looking for them you would probably never see them. They are that small, faint and unnoticeable. ","\n","\nThis Snare Drum comes with a new, unplayed and autographed 14\" Remo Weatherking Tattoo Skyn Head that was signed by Jim Riley and also comes with the original REMO Weatherking Ambassador Snare side head. The original unsigned 14\" REMO Weatherking Coated Ambassador Batter Head, that Jim actually played on this Snare Drum during this clinic, is also included with this auction. ","\n","\nAs you can see...Jim Riley, the drummer and band leader of Rascal Flatts, signed the interior and top head of his signature snare drum manufactured by Ludwig. It was signed on March 5, 2014 before my first private drum lesson with Jim at his Drum Dojo in Goodlettsville, TN. The Drum Dojo is in the basement of his home and this drum was signed on both the inside and on the 14 inch Tattoo Skyn Head. According to the owner of the Reno, Nevada Drum Center / Music Store I purchased it from, Jim Riley is the only person to ever play this snare drum during a clinic that he sponsored in 2013. I purchased it from this Music Store / Drum Center and had Jim sign it during my first private drum lesson on the date noted above. A pic of Jim Riley and myself will be provided electronically as proof of the above statement. Very few of these Jim Riley Black Magic Stainless Snare Drums were ever produced and far fewer were signed by Jim Riley. I'll guarantee mine is the only one with Jim's autograph on a Tattoo Skyn Drum Head anywhere in the world!

Included are a pair of Model 1.1 and one Model 1.1c. These speakers have all been refoamed with great care and perform perfectly. They are in fantastic cosmetic condition, holding their classy black lacquer finish perfectly. ","\n","\nThe Model 1.1 bookshelf speakers have a unique angled front baffle which angle the drivers to face towards the main listening position. This allows the speakers be be placed in an aesthetically pleasing manner while maintaining optimal sound fidelity. The Model 1.1c excludes this angled baffle so that it can also be placed directly in front of the listening position. The 1.1c lacks the NHT logo branding on the grill so that you can place it horizontally and still have it appear aesthetically pleasing.","\n","\nThe Model 1.1 and 1.1c were intelligently designed to have uniform sound production across your front soundstage. It is very common to find modern center channel speakers which have multiple woofers which are different sizes than the woofers in the left and right speakers. This produces issues with phasing as well as issues with overall coherence. NHT built the 1.1c to be identical to the 1.1 in order to eliminate these issues. The cabinet of the 1.1c is obviously a different shape than the 1.1, but its dimensions have been adjusted to keep the same internal volume. These speakers were very well thought out. It is always ideal to perfectly match your front LCR speakers.","\n","\nI'm selling the same set on eBay for $275 with 15 Watchers. I'm offering a good discount to local buyers.

This one has the highly desirable 6.0 liter LS2 corvette engine, found only in the 05's and 06's, and it runs so sweet. You will appreciate the extra hundred horses that these later models make over the earlier 03's and 04's. This SSR is one of the highest optioned ones made. Automatic transmission. Auxiliary gauge package. Power everything, including the super easy, power convertible hardtop. It even has the optional locking cargo boxes, the ultra rare trailer hitch, rosewood bed strips, and cargo net. Everything works flawlessly. Garage kept. Extremely well maintained. Brand new tires and battery. Needs nothing. The running boards and wheel center covers were removed for a sportier look. They go with the vehicle, and we'll even re-install them for you, if you want. Clean NC title. Mileage may go up slightly.","\n","\nKeywords: Chevy Truck Hotrod    "],"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null}
