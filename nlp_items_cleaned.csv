"Sadly, I am having to sell my beloved '76 vintage Shasta. I've only had it for one year, but we just do not have the time and energy to invest in getting her exactly where she needs to be. So it is a project that needs to be passed along to someone that can put their love and devotion into it. It is basically functional as is, but there are some upgrades and remodels that it definitely needs. My husband did put new tires on it last summer and we took it down to the beach. We did not use the water system only the electricity. The guy I bought it from last year said that a family of three was living in it while their house was getting built, so as far as I know the water system is also functional. We bought a brand new window AC unit for it. My husband also bought several sheets of wood paneling to start replacing some of the deteriorated and rotted wall sections. He did complete one section behind the main bed. So the camper will come with the sheets of paneling and the brand new air conditioner. My husband also bought a new hitch for it. I had it deep cleaned Last Summer. Although it's been sitting for awhile and could use another good cleaning. So we have invested close to $700 in it already.

"Here's a couple fun tidbits from your friends at Performance Auto Sales on Hwy 321 just down from the Wal-Mart. Did you know that most 2WD trucks are rated to tow more weight than a 4X4?

With that in mind, this 2012 2WD Toyota Tundra would be perfect for almost everyone. It's got a gas saving 4.0L V6, spray in bed liner, BBS rims, all power equipment, fog light, keyless entry, alarm ,cruise control, armrests, floor mats, CD, AC, and more.

"THIS IS NOT SPAM. The other one that looks like mine and using my words IS spam 2007 Yamaha Waverunner FX Cruiser High Output that is in excellent condition. This is the FX again, not the cheaper VX model. It has 65.9 hours on it. This is averaging 6 hours per year. It has the 160 hp MR-1 engine that runs flawless. It has the manual trim setting so you can run nose high for speed or nose down for skiing or tubing. This is the 3 person ski and it is made for comfort. Gauge cluster works and is crystal clear, no fogging. Seat is in perfect condition. It comes with a remote to lock the ski so no one can steal it and it also activates the training mode for learning purposes. The body has a couple small places on it as I have tried to show in the pictures, most ski's get this much damage really quick. No dock rash at all. The keel has the normal scratches on it but no gouges or holes. New battery less than a year ago. Fresh spark plugs with oil and filter change and I have the old oil and filter if you are interested in checking it out. Compression is great. All cylinders are between 180 and 190 psi, see pictures, and I can do it again if cash in hand. Trailer is in great condition. It has been adult owned its whole time. It has been kept in a heated garage all winter so no worries of freezing. It comes with the trailer, cover, one remote, and the fresh water flush hose adapter. I am not interested in any trades so don't ask. I am not needing to sell so no lowball offers. Price is firm. CASH only. Calls ONLY due to all the texting and email spam.

It has the manual trim setting so you can run nose high for speed or nose down for skiing or tubing. This is the 3 person ski and it is made for comfort. Gauge cluster works and is crystal clear, no fogging. Seat is in perfect condition. It comes with a remote to lock the ski so no one can steal it and it also activates the training mode for learning purposes. The body has a couple small places on it as I have tried to show in the pictures, most ski's get this much damage really quick. No dock rash at all. The keel has the normal scratches on it but no gouges or holes. New battery less than a year ago. Fresh spark plugs with oil and filter change and I have the old oil and filter if you are interested in checking it out. Compression is great. All cylinders are between 180 and 190 psi, see pictures, and I can do it again if cash in hand. Trailer is in great condition. It has been adult owned its whole time. It has been kept in a heated garage all winter so no worries of freezing. It comes with the trailer, cover, one remote, and the fresh water flush hose adapter. I am not interested in any trades so don't ask. I am not needing to sell so no lowball offers. Price is firm. CASH only. Calls ONLY due to all the texting and email spam. If no answer please leave a message and I will call back. I don't need any help selling this. I'm more than capable myself."

"Needs complete restoration. VIN plate in place and untampered with, but fender build code tag is missing. Comes with clean and clear North Carolina title in my name. VIN decodes to: V - Plymouth Valiant, Duster, Scamp (""A"" body), H - High, 23 - 2 door hardtop, G - 318 1-2BBL 8 Cylinder ""LA"" engine, 2 - 1972, B - Hamtramck, Michigan, Car DOES NOT run and will need to be towed by buyer at the buyer's expense. This is a southern car that has never seen salt and has fantastic floorboards! It has minor and very fixable rust with some sloppy bondo work in the quarter panels and along lower rear roofline. The underside of the car, frame rails, doors, sills, trunk, hood, and decklid are all in good shape. Glass is all there and in good shape without excessive wear or clouding. It looks like it has been painted several times, but the original paint looks like it was Petty Blue. It looks like it was a highly optioned car when new, but without the fender tag I am not sure of exactly which options it came with. I have no idea how many miles it has as it has no speedometer. It is an original console and bucket seat car, but no seats are included. 318 engine has been partially dismantled and heads are just sitting on the block. The tires hold air and car rolls easily, but has no brakes. It does not run obviously and will need to be towed. It is up to the buyer to arrange pickup or shipment. I will sell to anyone in the world, but again, the buyer must handle all arrangements. I can meet a shipper or the buyer themselves to assist with access to the lot, but loading is up to you. Car comes with a fresh and clear North Carolina title. This is a project that obviously does need a complete restoration, but it is an excellent start. You're not going to find another one in this good of shape for this kind of money anywhere. The pictured parts lot can come with the car at the asking price, but if you don't need it we can negotiate on price. I also have a complete, built 318 4bbl engine with 20k miles on a stand, another known good 904 auto, and other various parts available separately if interested.

"2013 Jaguar XF Supercharged 3.0 V6 RWD Only 42,000 Miles Beautiful Lunar Metallic Gray Color If you want both Luxury and Performance then you have found your vehicle! This car is in great condition and very clean inside and out. The jaguar XF is impressive, stylish and full of power. This XF is Equipped with a V6 3.0 Supercharged engine with an 8 speed Automatic transmission. The 3.0 Supercharged gives you 340hp and remarkable performance. The XF is by far the smoothest ride I have ever driven. The electronic suspension provides you with a very pleasant ride whether your cruising or wanting to whip through the curves this thing will grip the ground and GO. If you are looking for speed, hit the checkered flag button and it will take the performance to a whole another level. The appearance is stunning and definitely turns heads out on the road! It is a Jaguar so you know it comes fully loaded, I will name some of my favorite features. It has all powered, top grain heated leather seats, touch screen navigation that has many options including Bluetooth for your music and hands-free driving, rear backup camera and parking sensors on the front and backside, also has auto adjusting mirrors which all make backing up easier. Blind spot sensors on mirrors. Auto bright headlights which means it senses oncoming cars and will turn your high beams off and back on accordingly. Auto start/stop which means the car has the ability to shut off at a stop light and automatically start back up when you hit the gas. Sunroof. Keyless entry and keyless start. Powered blind shade in rear window. Much more. This car sold new for around 60 grand. We are obviously offering you this vehicle at a significantly lower price. We specialize in Jaguar rebuilds and particularly the XF. I personally own a couple of these myself that we did rebuilds on, so I am a big fan. We purchased this vehicle from an insurance company after it was involved in a light wreck. We were SHOCKED that this car was issued a salvage title. However, the vehicle has been completely repaired and has been issued a rebuilt title. We do have before pictures of the car if you would like to see them before purchasing. The front bumper, hood and fender only needed repaired and not replaced so that tells you it wasn't that much of a hit. The front wheel was replaced along with the upper control arm and few other small pieces. There were NO air-bags deployed, this was a light hit and a very easy fix. The state of Tennessee inspected the vehicle to assure the rebuilt has been done according to manufacturer specifications before issuing the rebuilt title. Having a rebuilt title does not mean anything in my opinion, the title looks exactly the same as a clear title, you can receive the same insurance on the vehicle as a clear title. The only difference is you are saving $$$$. The vehicle is located in Kodak, TN. 30 Minutes east of Knoxville. Just off the same exit as Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg.

"We are selling our Graco Sous Chef Highchair. It's in excellent condition and from a non smoking, pet-free home. This little gem is perfect for your little one from the time you get home from hospital up until toddlerhood as a separate booster seat at the 'grown-up's table.' Especially good for: •Mothers recovering from c-section •Families with an older child at home (prevents older siblings from trying to 'feed' new baby things like Legos or acorns, etc) •Traveling for visits to family/friends where house has animals or is not childproofed •Bringing baby to bathroom so mom can take shower •And more! This Highchair/Skychair(our term for the infant seat!) is incredibly versatile and continued to surprise us with all the features! It's height adjustable, the infant bucket seat detaches to serve as a table-top or floor unit, the highchair seat reclines for easy bottle feeding once baby has outgrown the bucket seat, and the 'Skychair' combo (infant setup) packs easily into car for travel. Oh, and the front wheels are lockable, to dissuade siblings from introducing early joyrides to little sister/brother. The infant bucket seat has a play bar that can be folded out above baby to play with plush stars, but (!) we are missing one of the stars and in my opinion, the play bar was always a little flimsy. I continue to search for the missing star, though, and promise to contact buyer in future should it turn up.

Boat runs around 21 mph and pulls a tube and knee board All lights work Tach doesn't work but warning lights and other functions do Speedometer works, but it needs the water pickup piece replaced on the toon. Trim gauge works Voltage meter works The engine starts and runs well. It is still on oil injection but can easily be switched to premix if that makes you more comfortable. I have a snap down cover but it needs some patching. Boat has a clear title. Trailer has no title but I have bill of sale from Tennessee where I bought it. NC will title it if you wish.

"I have a 2001 Nissan maxima. It has 267k miles. My mom bought the car some time back in the early 2000's, and was the 2nd owner. It has always been a midlands South Carolina car. My little brother drove it in college and following. It's been a great car. Still has all the power you'd expect from a Maxima, even even you're passing someone on the interstate. Tires are great on the alloys! Sunroof and windows work. Cloth seats. It is dirty. It has dents and dings. People have brushed up against it from time to time. A deer ran into the side of it years back. It has clearcoat flakes. The armrest is broken. The alternator needs a replacement bolt, but it is held tight in place, and doesn't move. (People tend to lose the top bolt for some reason in these.) If I kept it forever, I'd probably do a tune up and change the engine seals. It does leak oil like an old Nissan. (We'll call it built-in corrosion protection for the engine bay, hahaha!) However, it'll crank every time, drive quickly anywhere you need to go, and do so reliably. It doesn't seem to be leaking any fluids other than oil. This is just an extra car for us, and I have loaned it out to friends who drive it thousands of miles without a problem. If you need a good starter car that you don't have to worry about denting, this is the one. The engines/transmissions usually go 400k miles or so, so it should be good for you for a while if you continue to take good care of it mechanically like my family did!",35.4637,Unspecified,-82.5354,1500.0,2001 Nissan Maxima,https://asheville.craigslist.org/cto/d/2001-nissan-maxima/6512356066.html,"2001 Nissan Maxima. $1500.0.

Your looking at a 1984 GMC that came with the straight six and Granny 4 speed with 4 wheel drive...rare to find these trucks now days. I have owned this truck for years and only used it to bring firewood down off the mountain here at home. It was never used on the road. shows 93042 miles on the odometer.Tires look like new with no plugs or patches... And she's rusty and ruff...but I love the old truck and she has served Me well....just dont need it any longer. Engine runs and the trans shifts good and the clutch is good and brakes are good....4 wheel drive works as it should. Will not come with a battery but I will have one in it to show that it runs. It would be great to drop a car body down on...lol...but that's just Me... ;0) I want $500.00 cash firm for the ol truck...it has to be worth that. I do have a clean N.C. title for it (in my name).

"I have a well maintained 2002 Ford F-150 XL for sale. I have had the truck for 5 years and have had no major issues with it. My father and I replaced the transmission soon after I got the truck. Haven't had any problems since then. Has a 4.2L v6 engine and a 5 speed manual transmission. This was my daily driver until I suffered a knee injury and can no longer push the clutch in without knee pain. If not for that, I would be keeping the truck. I have an automatic vehicle that I drive now. The Ford has been sitting for about four days now but I crank it up every couple of days to keep it circulating. Three of the tires have about 6,000 miles left on them. The other is a newer tire at about half life. I have the other three to the set and will through them in the deal. They are also about half life. The truck does have a few dents and dings on it but is a very reliable truck. I have never been left stranded with this truck. Dents are from previous owner.

"I have a hot tub that needs some TLC but if you are handy it may be a fun project for you. To answer questions about what it would take to make it a usable hot tub.......there are no pumps, no controls, and no cover. But as is it would be easy to make a neat little pool for the kids, and summer is right around the corner :) It would make a great pond for plants or fish, or maybe a raised bed garden for vegetables. Could also be used as a water trough for cows or horses. Turn it upside down and cut a hole in the side and all of a sudden you have a little house for your goats. The possibilities are endless and it is cheap. This hot tub is pretty large, 79"" x 79"" and 32"" high. It holds 300 gallons. Selling for only $200.

Retailed for $100 at Target, price is firm as all pieces are included, a few minor scratches on the windshield from play (not visible in photos). Lights work, plays music. A really neat toy, she just isn't into dolls as much as she is Legos. Can meet in Mills River, Pisgah Forest, Brevard, Etowah. Cash only please."

"2008 used food trailer. This is a 2008 20' x 8'.5"" Diamond enclosed trailer always stored inside until I bought it in October 2017 at which it has sit in my yard outside. It was a car hauling trailer prior to renovation in November 2017. We built it into a Yadkin County NC NSF approved food trailer. I'm selling this food trailer as is used although it has never been cooked in. The trailer has practically all new equipment with some pieces of used equipment. I will specify in a moment. This trailer had been pulled a1000 miles since new, this trailer is a top of the line trailer. It has new NSF approved vinyl flooring, it also has white vinyl walls and ceiling, no leaks. The trailer has a large swing open door on the right side and a drop down door in the back with a spring loaded cable to assist up and down. Inside drop down door is painted white.

"We are Mountain Mule Hardwoods, a small business in the Tri-Cities TN area making hardwood furniture and gifts. We sell mostly online and ship all over the country, but we would like to do more business locally. All of the furniture we make is custom made to order, and made from American hardwoods: ash, red oak, white oak, maple, ambrosia maple, curly maple, quarter-sawn white oak, cherry and walnut. Our furniture is finely sanded and finished simply in non-toxic linseed oil, to reveal the natural color and beauty of the wood grain. We build a lot of furniture for chemically sensitive people, often beds for people buying organic mattresses. With everything we build, we think about safety, usability, functionality and durability of our pieces for generations of use. We do not offer any wood stain, but some people buy our furniture unfinished to stain or paint themselves. We do not have a storefront, but would love to hear from you if you are interested in getting a piece made. You are welcome to come to our shop by appointment, to select lumber, see our work in progress, or discuss specifications. We offer so many custom options, including different leg choices, mixed woods, beds set up for a mattress only or mattress + box springs, larger or smaller headboards and rails, etc. You can see more pictures and prices at our website www.mountainmulehardwoods.com and Etsy, or follow us on Facebook and Instagram. (Most Etsy prices include shipping, so please inquire if you want local pricing.) We deliver to Tri-Cities, Asheville, Knoxville, and even farther for larger orders. We do offer a discount when buying several pieces. Before you buy poorly-constructed Chinese-made furniture from a chain furniture store, consider getting something built to last from solid American hardwoods and supporting a hard-working family-owned local small business. :) Platform beds without a headboard (no shipping, includes kiln-dried poplar slats) start around: Twin $650 | Full $675 | Queen $700 | King/Cal King $725 Platform beds with a small 12"" headboard (no shipping, includes kiln-dried poplar slats) start around: Twin $800 | Full $825 | Queen $850 | King/Cal King $875 Walnut (the darkest wood) is the most expensive wood choice, and for example, a king with a 20"" headboard and kiln-dried poplar slats would be around $1500 without shipping.

"We are Mountain Mule Hardwoods, a small business in the Tri-Cities TN area making hardwood furniture and gifts. We sell mostly online and ship all over the country, but we would like to do more business locally. This bed is made and ready to be delivered. It was just completed (Feb 10, 2018) and has never been used. The price is significantly less than it would be to order one. SIMPLE CURVES This classic bed design features a large headboard and footboard, both curved with an elegant simplicity. The wide rails and sturdy legs make it very strong. The bed pieces are finely sanded and the edges are rounded over to make them feel nice and smooth. CURLY AMBROSIA MAPLE This beautiful and unusual wood can really make a statement in your bedroom! Ambrosia Maple is maple that has been infested by ambrosia beetles, which cause grayish blue to brown streaks over the golden or pinkish colored maple. Not to worry- once kiln dried, the bugs are gone! The head and footboard of this bed are also curly, which is not a common occurrence. Ambrosia maple is sometimes called wormy maple or ghost maple, because the shapes can look like ghosts. Because wood is a natural product, its beauty marks are normal, and may include knots, knot holes, worm holes, large streaks or sections of light or blond sapwood and/or variations in grain and color. These variations are what make this a one-of-a-kind piece. OUR BEDS Our bed frames are handcrafted from furniture-grade kiln-dried solid American hardwoods. Thoughtfully designed and constructed to last for generations, our beds are finished simply to reveal the natural beauty of the wood. With everything we build, we think about safety, ease of use, practicality and durability of our pieces for generations of use. SPECS Headboard: 19.5"" curved curly ambrosia maple Headboard runs from 25.25"" - 44.75"" from the floor Legs at headboard: 2.25"" x 2.25"" x 45.5"" tapered, walnut Legs at foot: 2.25"" x 2.25"" x 21.75"", tapered, walnut Foot rail: 14"" curved curly ambrosia maple Foot rail runs from 7"" - 21"" from the floor Rails: 8"" ambrosia maple Clearance under the rails: 7"" Finish: 3 coats of satin polyurethane, more durable than our typical oil finish but NOT low-VOC SUPPORT OPTIONS This bed is ideal for mattress and/or box springs with a total thickness of 10.5"" - 12"". If you have box springs, you will use 3 kiln-dried poplar support slats as pictured in the listing photos. If you have just a mattress, we will add a platform with 8 kiln-dried poplar slats.

I'm sure I'll forget something but here's my best attempt.

It has the EGR delete and blue spring fuel mod. I just installed 2 brand new batteries in November. It has an SCT tuner, tuned for fuel economy. On the inside: Tan cloth interior (normal driver side seat tear), all new speakers in factory locations with an amp mounted under the front center seat, Pioneer in-dash touch screen DVD player that does everything including hands-free, Bluetooth, and has a backup camera.

"I have for sale a very nice 2000 Honda Accord. It's an EX, four-door sedan. Black in color. Clean title. The current engine needs to be replaced but once that is done, you'll have a nice ride. The current engine sustained an oil leak that I suspect caused it to seize up. I never had it properly diagnosed, but it won't start. The car has just been sitting in my driveway for the past year, so it's dirty on the inside and out. I had the automatic transmission re-built when I first bought this car. Power windows, locks, etc. I had the stock stereo replaced with an aftermarket. There's very little cosmetic damage - just minor scratches here and there. The battery is currently dead so I can't check the odometer (which is electric) but I believe it's around 190,000 miles. As you can see from the picture, there is A LOT of potential for this car.

The car has just been sitting in my driveway for the past year, so it's dirty on the inside and out. I had the automatic transmission re-built when I first bought this car. Power windows, locks, etc. I had the stock stereo replaced with an aftermarket. There's very little cosmetic damage - just minor scratches here and there. The battery is currently dead so I can't check the odometer (which is electric) but I believe it's around 190,000 miles. As you can see from the picture, there is A LOT of potential for this car. My asking price is $600. If interested, please contact me by e-mail or text. Thanks!"
"Size of embroidery - 9x19"". There is 1"" on two sides (short and long) and 2.5"" on the other two sides (short and long) of empty canvas around the embroidery for stretching it. The canvas is naturally askew after it is embroidered, but it will straighten out after proper stretching on a frame. This needlepoint embroidery was sewn meticulously by hand following a store-bought pattern in Bulgaria. It was done by my mother who lives in Bulgaria, but I own her pieces in the states and I am selling it for her. The color and integrity of the thread is intact.

Typically they start laying around 16-24 weeks old so you only need to wait about 11 weeks before you start looking for eggs. Why don't we sale laying hens? At 5-7 weeks old these chickens are young enough to learn you as their care taker, learn their home before they start to lay, and it is the most efficient as far as price.

"SUMMER will be here before we know it! Income tax refunds are rolling in! It's a great time to get in on a great deal on this..... 2017 Sea Doo Spark 2 UP $6600 This Sea Doo Spark was purchased brand new in May 2017. Only 34 hours/34 minutes on it The price includes upgrades such as: Tuned from 60 HP to 90 HP Using MapTuner Front storage bin addition Re-boarding step Fitted Sea Doo Cover 2 life vests. The 2017 Sea Land'r trailer is included in this package as well. This Sea Doo Spark is playful, easy-to-ride and easy to tow with a small car. Maptuner was used to tune sea doo from it's original 60 HP to 90 HP (ROTAX 900 HO ACE - 899 cc four-stroke engine specs.) This is an expensive, performance upgrade! It allows for the creation of the most compact and lightweight engine on the market. Built with the acclaimed Advanced Combustion Efficiency technology it's also the most fuel-efficient watercraft in the industry¹ while still delivering excellent power-to-weight ratio.) This machine screams out of the hole! Fast and fun on the water. As pictured, there are only 34 hours and 34 minutes on it. There is only normal, minor wear and tear from minimal use on the water. It has been covered and garage kept since purchase. This upgraded, nicely outfitted Sea Doo will not disappoint! Color: Lime Green Length 2up: 110"" / 279 cm weight capacity 352 LB / 160 KG (2UP) Fuel: 87 octane Intake System: Naturally aspirated Exoskel Is a minimalist architecture that keeps only the essential structural parts in the front section. It reduces the weight while creating a strong, modern and cutting-edge design that defines the unique and playful nature of the Sea-Doo SPARK. POLYTEC Is a recyclable, low density and high-impact composite material that includes polypropylene and long glass fiber reinforcements. It was designed for hull and deck applications to maintain the structural integrity of the watercraft under stress while providing light yet durable parts to support the construction of the product. iTC™ (INTELLIGENT THROTTLE CONTROL) SYSTEM Fly-by-wire system that works electronically (no cables) to transfer the input from the throttle lever to the engine. It's a more responsive and precise throttle control that generates better engine calibration and fuel consumption. It also allows for different riding modes like the sport mode that's available with the Rotax 900 HO ACE engine and it's activated by pressing the button under the cluster for 3 seconds. D-SEA-BEL™ SYSTEM Combines a series of resonators and vibration-absorbing components to make Sea-Doo watercraft some of the quietest on the water. Closed-Loop Cooling System Uses coolant to keep the engine running at the ideal temperature, much like a car's radiator. Also keeps out corrosive saltwater and debris. Interactive Multifunction Digital Information Center Touring mode, Sport mode (HO engine), Fuel level, Tachometer, Speedometer, Hour meter.

She really didn't play with them much and they have been in tubs in her closet for a couple of years. She decided she wants to pass them along to somebody else. You get everything shown in the pictures. The Darth Vader helmet does work. It talks when you push the buttons and has a microphone inside you can talk into. The 2 lightsabers work as well.

"I am selling my Vinnie Paul autographed drum head. I got this when I saw Damageplan live in Atlanta at The Masquerade, October 27th 2004. THE HEAD WAS USED BY VINNIE DURING THE SHOW! He broke it during their set. At the very end of the show he came to the front of the stage and tossed it out into the crowd. And I was lucky enough to catch it. It was already signed before he tossed it. This was just about a month before the horrible tragedy that happened on Dec 8th. This truly is an awesome piece of music history with this being used and signed by Vinnie when Dime was still alive and they were playing together. I do not have a certificate of authenticity or anything like that because I was at the show and know it's authentic and I never intended on needing to sell it. But if you wanted to have that done, I guarantee it will pass ANY credible authentication you choose to use. It's the absolute real deal. It hangs easily on the wall or you could have it framed.

I am selling my Vinnie Paul autographed drum head. I got this when I saw Damageplan live in Atlanta at The Masquerade, October 27th 2004. THE HEAD WAS USED BY VINNIE DURING THE SHOW! He broke it during their set. At the very end of the show he came to the front of the stage and tossed it out into the crowd. And I was lucky enough to catch it. It was already signed before he tossed it. This was just about a month before the horrible tragedy that happened on Dec 8th. This truly is an awesome piece of music history with this being used and signed by Vinnie when Dime was still alive and they were playing together. I do not have a certificate of authenticity or anything like that because I was at the show and know it's authentic and I never intended on needing to sell it. But if you wanted to have that done, I guarantee it will pass ANY credible authentication you choose to use. It's the absolute real deal. It hangs easily on the wall or you could have it framed. It looks awesome. Please just message me with the craigslist reply and I will promptly message you back and we can work out all the details. I can meet you. Thanks alot!!! :)"

"SWR Grand prix tube preamp and Carvin DCM1000 in light weight 3 space rack. The SWR Grand Prix is stunning in tone. Clean warm tube preamp. Better than the SWR heads. Ultra clean until pushed and then the most beautiful subtle growl. It can be driven to crunch if that's your thing but this is not a distortion preamp, it is all about tube clean. I've tried pretty much every bass preamp made and this is the best tube clean preamp in my opinion. These sell for $350 and up when they rarely pop up for sale. This is a vintage pre fender orig SWR california piece of gear. Carvin DCM1000 - These are good sounding very dependable power amps that work fantastic for bass. Unlike many power amps Carvins can go to 4 ohms in mono. Most bass players want to run at 4 ohms for punch and headroom and most power amps won't do that, carvins do. 3 space light weight rack bag. Sorry it's peavey logo'd ;-) It's actually kinda cheap but it's also light and small and does the job. Both units are in pristine condition. Both units work perfectly. They sound fantastic. There is one mismatched knob on the Grand Prix. Matching knobs are readily available. The idea with this rig is to get great preamp tone and loads of power in an as small and light as possible package without going to a digital power amp (the current small heads) which in my and many others opinions just don't cut it. This is real power and it sounds like it! The Grand Prix is very versatile with very powerful EQ (check pics) it can cover a lot of tones. It has the great subtle SWR defeatable limiter, the love it or hate it enhancer (I love it) and just gives you a big round punchy tube clean tone that you can EQ how ever you like. Very sweet in my opinion. If you like clean tube tone with tons of power: this is it! I have 2 Kappa loaded 1x12 cubes I may consider letting go for the right deal but are not otherwise for sale. Email your interest, Do not JUST send a phone #, pick up IN asheville only or ship at your cost w/ cleared prepayment.

"Up for sale is a pair of vintage EPI M-150 speakers, these are rare and don't come up for sale often. There's no sound coming from the tweeters, but there is from the woofer. The cabinets are in good shape, especially considering their age. They're made in real walnut veneer, with solid walnut and brass accents and look like a fine piece of furniture. Check out the gold inlays! There are some bumps and bruises, but I've taken good quality pics so there are no surprises. They were produced between 1973-1976, and are 25 x 15 x 11, and weigh approximately 40lbs. Sold as is. Please contact me if you have any questions. Thanks for checking out my ad. For replacement parts, check out a company called Human Speakers. Here are some specs and info from the web: Response: 35 to 18k Hz RMS Power: 15 to 60 watts (very conservative rating) Crossover: 1800 Hz 8"" woofer 1"" air spring dome tweeter Impedance: 8 ohms MSRP: 298.00 Built: 1973-76 The Model 150 offers all the musical benefits of the two smaller EPI models [ed. note: the Model 50 and Model 100] in an attractive, more easily positioned cabinet styling. Using the same great EPI 8"" module, this cabinet attains a system resonance of 35 cycles. This allows linear woofer operation down to the primary octave of all musical material even when positioned in a free standing location away from the walls in the center of a room, or similarly in the center of a large bookshelf. Depending on the size of the room a two wall positioning may be preferable. New construction and design principles are utilized in the Model 150 to provide an optimum combination of high performance and decorative cabinetry appearance. Functional in this design are the four anodized metal extrusions in each side which are first joined to solid walnut corner pieces are then attached mechanically to top and bottom caps (both one inch thick) where the walnut plugs are accented by circular brass inserts. As a finished piece of furniture, the Model 150 is a handsome creation of gleaming brass, rich solid walnut and a dark warm grill cloth. In a vertical position its 25"" height makes an attractive end table.

"Up for sale is a vintage Pioneer SX-1010 receiver. It is in very good condition and was completely restored in 2013. (See pics for complete list of work performed). It is very heavy at 49 lbs, and was produced between 1974 and 1976. The SX-1010 was supposedly the unit that started the ""receiver wars"" as it was the first one to hit 100 watts per channel. The SX-1010 was Pioneer's top of the line stereo receiver, in 1974-1976. The condition in very good, I took high quality pics so there are no surprises. Please contact me if you have any questions. Thanks for checking out my ad. A very nice Pioneer SX-1010 that was refurbished in 2013 - 165 Components replaced . Output was measured with 1000HZ sine wave and 8 OHM load present - 144 watts per channel observed clipping . Test was performed for a 10 second reading period. Included is a copy of the owners manual and the 7 page data sheet explaining everything done during the overhaul . Here are some specs: Features include an FM front end with dual-gate FETs, ceramic filters and ics in IF stages for sharp selectivity, quadrature detection, phase lock loop (PLL) stereo demodulator, all IC equipped AM section with linear dial, balanced positive and negative power supply with heavy duty components, and a phono equalizer with wide dynamic range and extremely close tolerances.

"Hello, I have a Volvo V50 T5, 2.5L 5Cylinder AWD Hatchback for sale. It has a clean title, but is in need of some work before it can be driven. On Kelly Bluebook car is listed between $2000-$4200. I originally purchased the car in Chicago in 2016. I have the vehicle title and car's entire history. The car needs a new timing belt and ignition coils before it can be driven. -There is misfiring and the camshaft and crankshaft correlation is off. -The timing belt has a small amount of oil on its edge, not certain as to how it got there. The roof liner is sagging some and will need new brake pads within 2500 miles. All in all this car has been reliable and taken me all around the United States. It handles incredibly well in all conditions and still feels like a luxury car. The Volvo has normal wear from use but no damage to the body or suspension. The issues listed above started last week and I immediately took it to be looked at. I am listing it is because I decided to purchase a newer vehicle rather than put the money into fixing this one. If you are familiar with cars and enjoy fixing them this car would be a great project. It would also be a wonderful source for parts. Serious inquiries only please. No trades.

"Hello, I love making things and spend a lot of my free time on personal projects. If you're looking for a custom sized bench, table, desk, shelf, chairs, bed frame, or something as small as a silverware drawer organizer.. I'd be happy to go over options with you. I studied fine art in college graduating with a BFA in sculpture and love the idea of mixed media pieces the most! For me to get started I require photos of items you like. I have attached some things I have made this past year. Please describe what about the piece in the photos you like most. I will also need the dimensions of the final product and some color options you're interested in. Ideas can range from simple clean modern designs to wood burning an entire piece with images of bears, frogs, faces, or foods. I can build chicken coops, sheds, decks, retaining walls, ramps, hang siding, paint interior or exteriors, etc.. If you have a wood/material preference we can discuss this before committing to a design. Most of what I work with is salvaged or upCycled materials to help the earth and keep costs down to labor alone. I have created items modeled after furniture designer sets like Pier One, West Elm, IKEA etc.. If you have had your eye on a particular furniture set let me know and we can work from there. All prices will be reasonable. The final cost will be determined directly by time and materials. I will be working for myself, for you, so it's all negotiable. I look forward to working with you and collaborating. Email with questions, concerns, ideas, or if you need advise on a project your doing. If you need help around your house I offer out call or handyman work for $15/hr. I can mow, trim trees, clean a pool, lay concrete, fix fence posts, replace siding, repair leaks, hang trim, frame and sheetrock walls, etc.. No project is unreasonable!!

"Due to worthless spammers, I ask for ""Calls only please"". I have 2 of these available. This 520 series is in like new condition: WEBMD. MAGNET THERAPY OVERVIEW INFORMATION Magnet therapy involves applying a magnet to the skin or close to the skin to improve a condition such as pain. The strength of magnets is described in terms of ""gauss"" or ""Tesla."" A Tesla is equivalent to 10,000 gauss. Magnets used for treatment usually have a higher magnetic strength than typical refrigerator-type magnets. Therapeutic magnets are most often in the range of 200-10,000 gauss. Typical household magnets are typically around 200 gauss. People wear magnets to treat painful conditions including general pain, pain after surgery, low back pain, foot pain, heel pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), carpel tunnel syndrome, painful menstrual periods, nerve pain caused by diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), sports injuries, and migraine headache. Magnets are also worn for treating water retention, wounds, male sexual performance problems (erectile dysfunction, ED), trouble sleeping (insomnia), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), epilepsy, trouble controlling urination (incontinence), and many other conditions. Magnet therapy is a big business. Worldwide sales of magnets for treatment is estimated at over $5 billion annually. In the US the market is about $500 million. How does it work? There is interest in magnet therapy for medical conditions due to the variety of electromagnetic fields that naturally occur within the body. For example, nervous system transmissions and related muscle contractions are associated with magnetic activity. The heart generates the largest magnetic field in the body. Several other activities in the body are associated with magnetic activity. At one time it was thought that abnormal magnetic fields in the body might result in certain disease states and that magnets could play a role in making these magnetic fields normal again. You may hear that magnets attract the iron in red blood cells, resulting in increased circulation. But this is wrong. The iron in blood cells is not in a magnetic form. However, magnets, in theory, could have an effect on other charged molecules in the blood and other parts of the body. There isn't enough information to know exactly how magnets might work in the body to treat disease or pain. mm216",35.602742,"Asheville, NC",-82.49136,375.0,Magnapack Magnetic bed cover,https://asheville.craigslist.org/hab/d/magnapack-magnetic-bed-cover/6499951965.html,"Magnapack Magnetic bed cover. $375.0.

"This amp is all you could ever want or need in a guitar amp. Make almost any sound imaginable! I have original price tag - $1699.99. This amp has barely been used - I only play acoustic. Also comes with original canvas full cover. Preparing to move overseas - must sell. More info: Fender Musical Instruments Corporation is proud to introduce the most revolutionary and ambitious new product in its fifty-five year history: The Cyber-Twin amplifier. The first amplifier ever capable of Cybernetic Amp Design (C.A.D.) technology that actually re-creates circuitry, the Cyber-Twin utilizes both analog and digital components to instantly become over 120 of the world's most sought after classic and modern classic amplifiers tones. Fender's world class team of engineers have spent more than three years of research and development on this extraordinary new amplifier. From day one, the intention was to follow the long-standing Fender tradition of innovation, and to set the standard by which all amplifiers will follow in the future. The result is the future of amplifiers, the Cyber-Twin Not another modeling� amp, the Cyber-Twin is a warehouse filled with the best of history's amplifiers housed in one cabinet, and whose electronic architecture literally reconfigures itself to become the amplifier that is selected. While a specific tonal quality may be digitally replicated by a modeling� amp to give a snapshot of an amplifier at a single setting, C.A.D. makes it possible for the Cyber-Twin to recreate the original amplifier's schematic and maintain its sonic personality, allowing it to become that amplifier. Senior vice president of marketing for Fender, Ritchie Fliegler, explains, DSP modeling amps may provide a one-dimensional snapshot of a very specific moment in time where a certain guitar is played at a certain volume by adjusting its equalizer. Once you turn up the gain or lower the treble, that moment is gone forever, and so is the amplifier the DSP is trying to emulate. C.A.D. literally reconfigures the Cyber-Twin's tone stack, as if there were a tiny robot inside with a soldering iron building each one of the amps,� adds Fliegler. Once the specific circuitry has been dialed up, the Cyber-Twin is an actual amplifier that delivers the living, breathing response of the original. If you dial up a classic Fender amplifier like a Bassman or a 65 Twin, you couldn't tell the difference if you were blindfolded.� The versatility of the Cyber-Twin, however, does not stop at classic and modern classic Fender tones. While most Fender amplifiers feature a tone stack that's placed before the preamp, many other classic sounds are from amplifiers that have the tone stack after the preamp, like many of the popular British models. The Cyber-Twin has the capability of moving the tone stack either before or after the preamp, offering the best of American and British amplifier voicings. With the familiar Fender control panel, the Cyber-Twin is playable right out of the box. There are 35 classic and modern classic pre-set amplifiers to choose from, which are accessible by a large control dial. Playing a Bassman, for example, is as simple as dialing it up and using the standard amplifier controls to get a desired tone. Using the world's most revered amplifier circuits its building blocks, the Cyber-Twin also allows players to design their own amplifier sounds. The Custom Shop function features 85 of Fender's own pre-set creations, all of which are fully adjustable to allow musicians to go as deep as they want into their own personal tonal preferences. Once adjusted, new sounds can be saved in the Player's Lounge for 85 added possibilities. Four Quick Access keys provide instant assignment and recall of a player's favorite Amp Design pre-sets, all of which can also be accessed remotely with the included four-button footswitch. The Cyber-Twin features 130 Watts of stereo output (65 Watts per channel) through 2x12� Celestion G12T-100 speakers (8 Ohms). Two 12AX7WA vacuum tubes are used in the preamp, and there are four tone stacks which can be placed before or after the distortion circuitry. The Cyber-Twin truly is the Holy Grail of all amplifiers, explains Fliegler. With Cybernetic Amp Design, we've taken musical possibilities to a level never before attainable with one single amp.

"These are energy efficient, natural light skylight sun tunnels. The kit includes everything including a 24"" extension for a total of 6 feet length of tunnel. You can add more extension up to a max 20 feet per the Velux documentation. We purchased two sets of Velux 14"" Rigid SUN TUNNEL Skylights with 24"" extensions to add natural light to our home. Our friends have several of these in their home, and never need to use inside lights during the day. During the remodel we ended up replacing all the windows in the residence, and didn't need the additional light from skylights. We have two of these new in the box never used. $428 New = $350 for SUN TUNNEL Skylight + $50 (24"" extension) + Tax You can check out veluxusa dot com for more info. More: Installing VELUX Sun Tunnel tubular skylights is a great way to brighten any space with energy-efficient natural light.

"Like new inversion table for back pain relief. This table helped me rehabilitate a herniated disk. Basically, you stand in the device, lock in your feet, and use the comfortable hand holds to invert your body from an adjustable level from horizontal all the way to completely hanging. This not only takes the pressure off your back, but uses gravity to create traction in your spine to draw fluid back into your injured disks. Works great! Also works great as a core workout machine for inverted crunches, twists, etc. The table is extremely well built and will likely last forever. Highly adjustable for people of all sizes and shapes. Easily folds and stores in seconds. Like new. Fix your back! These tables sell for $300 - $400 online and at local stores.

"We are selling our 1997 Fleetwood Southwind Storm. It is 34 feet long and we have had it almost a year. We've only been able to camp in it once, due to the upgrades we did lasting through camping season. We absolutely love this RV and truly hate to think of selling it, but it would help us financially is the only reason we are willing to part with it. When we purchased it last year it had a few minor leaks, which we sealed and repaired the damage inside none of the leaks we repaired we from the roof and the floor wasn't effected either. We updated the interior during this process as well. It has brand new laminate flooring, and new carpet around the doghouse. New led reading lights in the bedroom. We painted the cabinets with the high end enamel cabinet paint. The shower and sink in the bathroom has been painted to update it with marine grade paint. We also turned a wardrobe into a set of bunkbeds, so this RV would easily sleep 7. The sofa is a jack knife sofa, and the dinette also converts to a bed. The awning is functional, but has seen better days. All the window awnings are in good shape minus some sun fading, except one which still provides shade but needs to be replaced. It has a brand new CO2 detector, brand new queen size mattress thats only been slept on once! It has an Onan generator. The parking break needs to be repaired, we've always used scotches so it hasn't bothered us, but wanted to mention it. As far as we know mechanically everything works well, and there aren't any leaks. We aren't sure about the propane system and the furnace, because we haven't really tested them. There is some staining above the shower that was there when we bought it, but it's not soft and hasn't leaked since we've owned it. There are a few cosmetic flaws on the exterior, but nothing too bad. We really do hate to even think about selling it, and are actually not going to be upset if we don't.

I have a early seventies Fender Bandmaster reverb head with matching 212 cab that I am looking to sell or trade for another amp. I recently had it serviced and retubed with Tungsols. I still have the original RCA blackplate tubes that came in it originally. They are worth a couple hundred dollars just themselves. There's nothing wrong with the amp I'm just looking for a different sound. Check out Reverb.com and look these up. They sell for a pretty good haul when they are together like this.

"Delta / Mini Kossel 3D Printer This is a ""Micromake D1"" clone. Perfectly running stock Micromake D1 firmware which is based on Repetier. Prints PLA beautifully and has a heated bed so you can also print ABS and other filaments if you desire. I have it dialed in to around 100 microns precision but I'm betting with a bit of tweaking it can become even more precise if you're that anal about it. Calibrating a Delta requires skills that are a bit too much for me to wrap my head around. I also have a Tevo Tarantula Cartesian so I don't really need this delta. This delta works great and is much faster than a Cartesian printer. I bought it to learn from but I'll stick to my Tevo. It's easier for me to calibrate. A backup of the original firmware is on the SD card, along with a customized version of Cura with a set up for ""auto-leveling"". Comes with the partial roll of PLA you see in the picture. Looks to be about 1/4 of a roll which will let you make a lot of stuff. I can give you a quick down and dirty lesson showing how to use the Cura auto-leveling feature but that is the extent of the ""technical support"" I will be able to offer.

"This 1969 camper has been refurbished and was used in food service in SC. The motif is silver, black, white and red. There are pinstripes along the sides with delicate red flames that were applied to shiny, solid metal siding. No leaks! The rims are custom red ones with newer Goodyear tires of thick tread. The box is 17 feet, tongue hitch adds 2-3 more ft. I do not know the towing weight. The floor was redone with black and white vinyl tile to match the black cushion upholstery. The cabinets were all refaced with a textured black metal that gives it a mod look. There is a newer refrigerator/freezer unit, in addition to a vintage electric/propane combo fridge above it. There is a 4 burner stove top with an oven. Wall outlets work and there is lighting. The ice-cold air conditioner is a quality Dometic combo air/heat ceiling unit that matches the black cabinets. There is adequate working space with facilities for a food service operation. The kitchen table converts to a full-sized bed. The bench seat area also allows for a full-sized mattress. Storage is abundant and throughout camper seats and overhead. A small drop-down table top is opposite the back wall, which was converted into a hatch that opens wide and can be secured open by chains to attach to embedded hooks. (See silver hatch in photo to view size). I understand it was open to an outdoor grill and allowed the passing of food items back and forth for rapid production. Plenty of windows light it up with sunshine. An exterior aluminum window cover folds down over the front windows. This camper makes a suitable dwelling for 1-2 people, especially a couple. No bathroom, but spacious open area in back allows room for commode and portable shower set-up for the savvy soul. Kitchen sink drains out through outflow pipe under exterior of camper. There is an awning and pull-out metal stairs. One portion of a panel of jalousie window cracked and has been sealed in with gorilla tape, no leaks. Included is a pre-cut pane of glass to fit the panel. There is also one other crack across one other window panel, though sealed and leak-proof. The tiles have seen traffic, though they are still intact, small areas of wear are evident. One small area of wood paneling has become frayed on the surface, yet the thickness of the wall is fully intact. There is a key for the door to lock up. We love this camper, but are upgrading in other areas of life, so we will sell her to a good home. Because SC does not require a title for trailers, it does not have one. A NC title can be applied for using the ""home made"" trailer designation, similarly to a new tiny home title, if you plan to roll her far and wide.

"This sweet camper is a great size for tiny living, with upgrades for comfort and appeal. The motif is silver, black, white and red. There are pinstripes along the sides with delicate red flames that were applied to shiny, solid metal siding. No leaks! The rims are custom red with newer Goodyear tires of thick tread. The box is 17 feet, tongue hitch adds 2-3 more ft. I do not know the towing weight. The floor was redone with black and white vinyl tile to match the black cushion upholstery. The cabinets were all refaced with a textured black metal that gives it a mod look. There is a newer refrigerator/freezer unit, in addition to a vintage electric/propane combo fridge above it. There is a 4 burner stove top with an oven. Wall outlets work and there is lighting. The ice-cold air conditioner is a quality Dometic combo air/heat ceiling unit that matches the black cabinets. There is a direct line for water hook-up to the double kitchen sink. There is adequate working space with facilities for a food service operation. The kitchen table converts to a full-sized bed. The bench seat area also allows for a full-sized mattress. Storage is abundant and throughout camper seats and overhead. A small drop-down table top is opposite the back wall, which was converted into a hatch that opens wide and can be secured open by chains to attach to embedded hooks. (See silver hatch in photo to view size). Plenty of windows light it up with sunshine. An exterior aluminum window cover folds down over the front windows. This camper makes a suitable dwelling for 1-2 people, especially a couple. No bathroom, but spacious open area in back allows room for commode and portable shower set-up for the savvy soul. Kitchen sink drains out through outflow pipe underneath camper. There is an awning and pull-out metal stairs. One portion of a panel of jalousie window cracked and has been sealed in with gorilla tape, no leaks. Included is a pre-cut pane of glass to fit the panel. There is also one other crack across one other window panel, though sealed and leak-proof. The tiles have seen traffic, though they are still intact, small areas of wear are evident. One area of wood paneling has become frayed on the surface, yet the thickness of the wall is fully intact. There is a key for the door to lock up. We love this camper, but are upgrading in other areas of life, so we will sell her to a good home. Because SC does not require a title for trailers, it does not have one. A NC title can be applied for using the ""home made"" trailer designation, similarly to a new tiny home title, if you plan to roll her far and wide. A long RV 120 volt power cord for 30-amp service is included.

"2000 Volvo V70 wagon with the rare 5 speed transmission. Runs and drives good. Body and interior are in good shape. Silver with tan leather interior. Heated seat, sunroof, new tires on factory alloy wheels, good factory radio, power windows, keyless entry. Paint is pretty nice, interior is in good shape, not ripped up or anything. Great Swedish car. Hard to beat a Saab or Volvo in terms of safety, they are solid cars. High miles at 320k but it's been well kept up. I bought it to 5 speed swap my V70R but have decided to look for an AWD tranny instead. This car is front wheel drive and normally aspirated, not turbo. Would be a great car to run around in or even a first car for your teenager. I've driven it some and it drives good. Clutch is a little weak, I'd keep driving it for a while but somewhere down the road it'll need a clutch. Much more fun to drive than the automatics! Gets good gas mileage too.

"A few things about the car, my husband bought it about a year-and-a-half ago. Drove it for six months until he bought himself a truck. Then it sat in our driveway for the past year. When he bought it, the odometer had already stopped working, so we do not know exactly how many miles is on it. The odometer now reads 230,000. In order to get it up and running and sell it, we took it to the mechanic a couple of months ago. Put over $600 worth of work into it. The mechanic said that he found a small transmission fluid leak. I drove it for a month straight after getting it out of the mechanics, and regularly checked the transmission fluid and it did not seem to have a significant impact on the transmission fluid level. But we did add a little bit after a month of driving it. It also tends to use a lot of oil, so it is good to check the oil level and add oil occasionally. I noticed today as I was cleaning out the trunk that it seems you have a leak in the trunk and there is dampness and moisture back there. It also appears that new tires are going to be needed at some point. I will say, that for the month of January while I was driving it, it ran pretty smoothly and I did not have any big issues with it. I was only driving it because my car was in the shop. I want to get it sold because we no longer need it. Asking $1800 OBO.

"Sadly, I am having to sell my beloved '76 vintage Shasta. I've only had it for one year, but we just do not have the time and energy to invest in getting her exactly where she needs to be. So it is a project that needs to be passed along to someone that can put their love and devotion into it. It is basically functional as is, but there are some upgrades and remodels that it definitely needs. My husband did put new tires on it last summer and we took it down to the beach. We did not use the water system only the electricity. The guy I bought it from last year said that a family of three was living in it while their house was getting built, so as far as I know the water system is also functional. We bought a brand new window AC unit for it. My husband also bought several sheets of wood paneling to start replacing some of the deteriorated and rotted wall sections. He did complete one section behind the main bed. So the camper will come with the sheets of paneling and the brand new air conditioner. My husband also bought a new hitch for it. I had it deep cleaned Last Summer. Although it's been sitting for awhile and could use another good cleaning. So we have invested close to $700 in it already. But as I say, it still needs some upgrades and remodels to really get it up to where she deserves to be. The pictures I took are of the beds pulled out for sleeping. But the main bed pushes back into a couch. The middle bed folds up and a table goes there. It also has a little loft bed above the main bed. My husband was able to identify one leak around the window area that he sealed and fixed. He also sealed the entire roof last summer.

"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PLEASE DO NOT E-MAIL ASKING IF THIS MACKIE CFX-16 MIXER IS STILL AVAILABLE! IF THIS AD IS ACTIVE...THE ITEM IS STILL AVAILABLE. I WILL IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THIS AD, AS I DO ALL OTHERS, UPON SELLING THE ITEM.

THANK YOU! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Hello Everyone, Up for your buying pleasure is my 16 Channel Mackie CFX-16 in like new condition. It comes with a high-impact road case which its been stored in since new and was $400.00 alone. I purchased this mixer specifically for my monitor mix system for a band I was developing that never materialized. Could not find the lead vocalist I was searching for! So, this Mackie CFX-16 Mixer and many other items I purchased for this project have or are being sold. Be sure to check out the list of other items being sold at the bottom of this ad. You'll be glad you did. If you desire additional pics of any of the items listed below...please e-mail me and I will forward them to you. My ""FIRM"" price of this Mixer & Case combo is $650.00. In fact, this Mixer's limited use and like new condition would increase its value above that of other used (junk) mixers selling for much more. It was $1,400.00 new! Thanks for checking out my ad and for your valued business! Doug ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ For you tech-heads...here is Mackie's Technical Specifications on this Mixing Board. Source URL: http://www.fullcompass.com/common/files/2033-CFXSeriesDataSheet.pdf The CFX™ Series mixers are comprised of stereo graphic equalizer and digital effects built in. The EMAC™ 32-bit digital effects processor was custom designed by our digital engineers and rivals the sound of many high-quality outboard processors. Like all of Mackie Designs' mixers, the CFX Series mixers are designed for rugged, day-in and day-out road use. Their sturdy-yet-light steel monocoque construction houses rugged, double-sided SMT-plated fiberglass circuit boards, and 60 mm faders with ultra-tight lip seals for keeping out dust and other contaminants. Impact resistant knobs are mounted so they ""ride"" just above the steel chassis--they absorb impact without trouble. Furthermore, they're designed to last, thanks to co-molded potentiometers that do not get brittle and crack up. Metal stand-offs are used at regular intervals to mount thick fiberglass circuit boards inside the mixer. These are extremely flexible mixers, not only because of their multiple input/output configurations, but also because of their 4 subgroups, 9-band graphic EQ, and built-in digital effects. The CFX•20 has 16 mic/line channels and two stereo line input channels. All mic/line channels have unbalanced inserts. Each channel strip has one external and one internal/external effects send plus two aux sends, pan, mute, solo (PFL), bus assigns, and 60 mm log-taper fader. The mic/line channels also have input trim controls with individual Zero Level LEDs, 3-band EQ with swept midrange, and 100 Hz low cut filters. Two separate stage monitor mixes can be created with their own effects levels. The CFX Series is a true 4-bus mixer, with four sub bus faders and master ganged Left/Right fader. Outputs include XLR and TRS balanced/unbalanced main outputs, a 75 Hz low-pass subwoofer XLR output, extra TRS Features • High headroom mic preamps • CFX•16 channels (12 mic/line mono, 2 stereo line • 32-bit EMAC digital effects • External and internal EFX sends • EFX to Monitor control • 9-band stereo graphic equalizer • Inserts on all mic channels and main mix • True 4-bus design with direct sub outs and L/R assign • 2 Pre/Post aux sends and internal/external FX level sends • 3-band EQ with swept mid (100 Hz to 8 kHz) on mic/line • 4-band EQ on stereo line channels • Pan, Mute, PFL solo on each channel • 100 Hz low-cut filters on all mic/line channels • Subwoofer output from built-in 18 dB/octave, 75 Hz crossover • Break switch mutes all channels • Headphone output with level control • Tape/CD inputs with level control assignable to Main Mix via Break switch • Logarithmic taper 60 mm faders • 48 V phantom power • 12 V BNC lamp jack applications • Live sound mixing for Churches, Clubs, Schools, Conference Centers, Tradeshows, Presentations, Keyboard, Drum Machine, and DJ mixing • A/V presentations, multimedia ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SCAMMERS...SAVE YOUR BREATH.

It comes with a high-impact road case which its been stored in since new and was $400.00 alone. I purchased this mixer specifically for my monitor mix system for a band I was developing that never materialized. Could not find the lead vocalist I was searching for! So, this Mackie CFX-16 Mixer and many other items I purchased for this project have or are being sold. Be sure to check out the list of other items being sold at the bottom of this ad. You'll be glad you did. If you desire additional pics of any of the items listed below...please e-mail me and I will forward them to you. My ""FIRM"" price of this Mixer & Case combo is $650.00. In fact, this Mixer's limited use and like new condition would increase its value above that of other used (junk) mixers selling for much more. It was $1,400.00 new! Thanks for checking out my ad and for your valued business! Doug ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ For you tech-heads...here is Mackie's Technical Specifications on this Mixing Board. Source URL: http://www.fullcompass.com/common/files/2033-CFXSeriesDataSheet.pdf The CFX™ Series mixers are comprised of stereo graphic equalizer and digital effects built in. The EMAC™ 32-bit digital effects processor was custom designed by our digital engineers and rivals the sound of many high-quality outboard processors. Like all of Mackie Designs' mixers, the CFX Series mixers are designed for rugged, day-in and day-out road use. Their sturdy-yet-light steel monocoque construction houses rugged, double-sided SMT-plated fiberglass circuit boards, and 60 mm faders with ultra-tight lip seals for keeping out dust and other contaminants. Impact resistant knobs are mounted so they ""ride"" just above the steel chassis--they absorb impact without trouble. Furthermore, they're designed to last, thanks to co-molded potentiometers that do not get brittle and crack up. Metal stand-offs are used at regular intervals to mount thick fiberglass circuit boards inside the mixer. These are extremely flexible mixers, not only because of their multiple input/output configurations, but also because of their 4 subgroups, 9-band graphic EQ, and built-in digital effects. The CFX•20 has 16 mic/line channels and two stereo line input channels. All mic/line channels have unbalanced inserts. Each channel strip has one external and one internal/external effects send plus two aux sends, pan, mute, solo (PFL), bus assigns, and 60 mm log-taper fader. The mic/line channels also have input trim controls with individual Zero Level LEDs, 3-band EQ with swept midrange, and 100 Hz low cut filters. Two separate stage monitor mixes can be created with their own effects levels. The CFX Series is a true 4-bus mixer, with four sub bus faders and master ganged Left/Right fader. Outputs include XLR and TRS balanced/unbalanced main outputs, a 75 Hz low-pass subwoofer XLR output, extra TRS Features • High headroom mic preamps • CFX•16 channels (12 mic/line mono, 2 stereo line • 32-bit EMAC digital effects • External and internal EFX sends • EFX to Monitor control • 9-band stereo graphic equalizer • Inserts on all mic channels and main mix • True 4-bus design with direct sub outs and L/R assign • 2 Pre/Post aux sends and internal/external FX level sends • 3-band EQ with swept mid (100 Hz to 8 kHz) on mic/line • 4-band EQ on stereo line channels • Pan, Mute, PFL solo on each channel • 100 Hz low-cut filters on all mic/line channels • Subwoofer output from built-in 18 dB/octave, 75 Hz crossover • Break switch mutes all channels • Headphone output with level control • Tape/CD inputs with level control assignable to Main Mix via Break switch • Logarithmic taper 60 mm faders • 48 V phantom power • 12 V BNC lamp jack applications • Live sound mixing for Churches, Clubs, Schools, Conference Centers, Tradeshows, Presentations, Keyboard, Drum Machine, and DJ mixing • A/V presentations, multimedia ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SCAMMERS...SAVE YOUR BREATH.

This Snare Drum was designed by Jim Riley and manufactured and sold by Ludwig, who endorses Jim Riley, the Drummer and Band Leader of Rascal Flatts. This is a very rare drum and the only one available on craigslist, Ebay or like it in the world. In fact, it's the only autographed one I've ever seen listed anywhere. It's certainly one any collector must have for their private collection. It is in like new condition with three small wear spots on the rims...see attached pics of highlighted area. The owner of the Drum Center in Reno, Nevada that I purchased it from stated these spots may have been caused by a microphone mount during the Drum Clinic he sponsored for Jim Riley in 2013. If you wasn't looking for them you would probably never see them. They are that small, faint and unnoticeable. This Snare Drum comes with a new, unplayed and autographed 14"" Remo Weatherking Tattoo Skyn Head that was signed by Jim Riley and also comes with the original REMO Weatherking Ambassador Snare side head. The original unsigned 14"" REMO Weatherking Coated Ambassador Batter Head, that Jim actually played on this Snare Drum during this clinic, is also included with this auction. As you can see...Jim Riley, the drummer and band leader of Rascal Flatts, signed the interior and top head of his signature snare drum manufactured by Ludwig. It was signed on March 5, 2014 before my first private drum lesson with Jim at his Drum Dojo in Goodlettsville, TN. The Drum Dojo is in the basement of his home and this drum was signed on both the inside and on the 14 inch Tattoo Skyn Head. According to the owner of the Reno, Nevada Drum Center / Music Store I purchased it from, Jim Riley is the only person to ever play this snare drum during a clinic that he sponsored in 2013. I purchased it from this Music Store / Drum Center and had Jim sign it during my first private drum lesson on the date noted above. A pic of Jim Riley and myself will be provided electronically as proof of the above statement.

"2007 Dodge Caravan SE 4dr Mini Van 4A Automat 4-Speed FWD This is a great little Minivan cold ac all windows work no check engine lights looks and runs great. Has clean title and no reported accidents. If you have a big family, but your pocket book says ""no"" to a big SUV, the Grand Caravan might be your next-best choice. Although still referred to as a minivan by the EPA, the Grand Caravan has long since outgrown any description with the word ""mini"" in it. This sizable people hauler can seat up to seven passengers and features Dodge's innovative Stow 'n Go seating, which allows the second and third-row seats to be folded flush into convenient floor wells. The Grand Caravan has a long list of standard and optional equipment. If you have a big family and are always on the go, the Grand Caravan is a great way to get around. The second-row captain's-chair seating and DVD entertainment system will keep the kids away from each other when they get bored, and the Stow `n Go seating lets you convert your family hauler into a cargo carrier with minimal effort. 1D4GP25B17B107351Make DodgeYear 2007Model Caravan SENo. of Historical Events 23Last Reported Event Date 2017-04-03Owners 4 Last Reported Mileage 157942Calculated Accidents 0 Call or Txt David with any questions or to come check it out.",34.697926,"Piedmont, SC",-82.46991899999999,2959.0,2007 Dodge Caravan SE 4dr Mini Van 4A Automat 4-Speed FWD,https://asheville.craigslist.org/cto/d/2007-dodge-caravan-se-4dr/6489388618.html,"2007 Dodge Caravan SE 4dr Mini Van 4A Automat 4-Speed FWD. $2959.0. 2007 Dodge Caravan SE 4dr Mini Van 4A Automat 4-Speed FWD This is a great little Minivan cold ac all windows work no check engine lights looks and runs great.

"This listing is for one set of Now Hear This (NHT) Model 1.1 home theater speakers. Included are a pair of Model 1.1 and one Model 1.1c. These speakers have all been refoamed with great care and perform perfectly. They are in fantastic cosmetic condition, holding their classy black lacquer finish perfectly. The Model 1.1 bookshelf speakers have a unique angled front baffle which angle the drivers to face towards the main listening position. This allows the speakers be be placed in an aesthetically pleasing manner while maintaining optimal sound fidelity. The Model 1.1c excludes this angled baffle so that it can also be placed directly in front of the listening position. The 1.1c lacks the NHT logo branding on the grill so that you can place it horizontally and still have it appear aesthetically pleasing. The Model 1.1 and 1.1c were intelligently designed to have uniform sound production across your front soundstage. It is very common to find modern center channel speakers which have multiple woofers which are different sizes than the woofers in the left and right speakers. This produces issues with phasing as well as issues with overall coherence. NHT built the 1.1c to be identical to the 1.1 in order to eliminate these issues. The cabinet of the 1.1c is obviously a different shape than the 1.1, but its dimensions have been adjusted to keep the same internal volume. These speakers were very well thought out. It is always ideal to perfectly match your front LCR speakers. I'm selling the same set on eBay for $275 with 15 Watchers. I'm offering a good discount to local buyers.

"Phattie Custom Drums 10/14/20/22 and matching 7x13 snare in Pre-Aged White Marine Pearl. Handmade in Asheville, NC by the late Dennis Stauffer in 2010. 8x10 tom, 12x14 floor tom, 18x20 & 20x22 bass drums, 7x13 snare. All maple shells with 45 degree edges. All the drums have tube lugs and the snare has a trick strainer/throwoff. The 20"" kick looks lighter than the rest of the kit, because it was ordered at a later date than the rest of the kit, and it hasn't quite ""aged"" to look exactly like the other drums yet. It's really not that noticeable when setup without the 22"" and especially on stage. This kit was used on tour for a few years and primarily kept in cases when not on stage. I'll be willing to sell the kit without the 20"" kick or without the snare. The kit is in Nashville, but I come through Asheville frequently, so could deliver for no extra charge.

"I have a very unique Toyota truck/camper for sale. I acquired this camper when a client was short on payment for Carpentry work completed about 2 years ago. I gutted the interior part of the camper due to it being filthy, and in disrepair. I had high hopes at the time to rebuild into a Tiny Home. After sitting in our yard for 6 months my girlfriend said enough is enough mainly because of the wonderful custom paint job (you'll see in pictures) and I relocated to a storage facility where it sat and I had no ambitions to work on it anymore...main reason...no electricity. I would periodically go and crank it up and just check on it in general. This thing is sweet hence why I took it for payment on work completed the odometer reads right at 69,000 miles roughly. The backstory I have on it is a guy parents lived in this thing full time only changing campsites 3 times in 15 years and when they passed away he was left with it. It makes perfect sense due to the very low miles. Apparently the engine is highly sought after, early on after ownership I was offered $1,200 for the engine at one time and I declined due to following my vision of a tiny home. I gutted the interior camper shell due to it being pretty nasty and mostly in disrepair. My plans were to rebuild into a tiny home to periodically travel and stay in. I dropped all plumbing and replaced some rotten flooring. I did leave the generator intact as you'll see in pictures. This thing has never failed to start it literally amazes me every single time I would go and crank it she'd fire right up. I have never did an oil change or anything mechanically other than a new battery. The storage facility where it was being kept has closed due to a death in the family, so here I am..ready to sell it and let someone give this thing some love and put it to great use. It is very clean considering its age. One could rebuild the interior for a tiny home/work truck/ or pull the camper off and make a 16' flatbed dually. The possibilities are endless.
